    <h1>Here are my dream dogs</h1>
    <p>If I could have a dog I would have three.</p>
    <p>The dogs I would get are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An older rescue dog</li>
        <li>A slightly overweight corgi</li>
        <li>A red Shiba Inu that looks like a fox</li>
      </ul>
    <p>But I cannot have a dog as I am in school and do not have the time or money to take care of one, <em>much less three</em>.</p>
